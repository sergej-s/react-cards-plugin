# React Cards Plugin - test task

jQuery plugin with React component inside. Two days. Tested mostly in Chrome. jQuery plugin takes list of cards info, composes a data object and provides it into a react component, which renders cards layout according the data.

JavaScript ContentCard/manager

Task: Build a JQuery plugin and a ReactJS component which will enable the following functionalities:

* The header and text paragraph (title/short description) should be in a block – the header should be preceded by an icon and the entire blog should have an image background.
* A transparent overlay with block manipulation options should be shown on “mouse over” (open, delete, print...)
* A group of such blocks should be responsive (i.e. 4 in one row on a high resolution, 2 in one row on smaller resolutions, with each mobile in its own row) and function in a Bootstrap v3 grid (default 12 cells per row)
* The blocks should have the same width/height regardless of state (etc. after resizing)
* Be especially mindful of the details (straight ellipsis, neat paddings/margins etc.) – visual design is as relevant as the software implementation.
